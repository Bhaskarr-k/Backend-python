# data types in python?
- in programing data type is an importent concept
- variables can store data of diffrent types and diffrent types can do diffrent things
- python has the following data types built in dafult in these categories
- data types divided inti two types they are given below.
-        single value data types
-        collection data types
## single value data types:
- it is divided into four types they are given below
-          integer
           float
           boolean
           complex
### integer:
- any m=number with out decimal part both positive and negutive consider as a integer
- ex: x=50
      print(type(x))
# what is type in python?
- type is a function by usinng this we can check the data type of variable
### float:
- any number with decimal part both positive and negutive is considered as a float
### boolean:
- boolean have inly two values **true** and **false**
- in python true considered as one
- and false ocnsidered as zero
## collection data types:
- it is divided into five typew theya re given below
-        string
         list
         tuple
         set
         dictionary
### string:
- string is declared suing sinlge quotes and double quotes thrible quotes
- single line string is declared using single quotes and double quotes where as multiple line string is declared using "" quotes
- string is ordered data type it supports indexing both positive and negutive
- string is immutable data it cant be modified
### list:
- elements inside list is declared using square brackets
- list is ordered data type it supports indexing
- list is mutable data type it cant be modified
- in python list is both homogenous and hetrogenous 
- homogenious means same data type can store multiple values
- hetrogenious means it can be store values with diffrent data types
### tuple:
- tuple is delcared using round brackets
- tuple is order data type
- tuple is immutable it cant be modified
- tuple is both both homogenious and hetrogeniuos
- tuple allows duplicates
# diffrenc ebetween list and tuple?
- eement sinside tuple is declared using round brackets where as list we can store square brackets
- tuple is immutable data type where as list is mutable data type
- to declare single value in tuple(,) comma is mandatorey where as inlist (,) comma is not mandatorey
### set:
- elements in set is declared using curly brackets
- empty set is declared using set () other wise python will considered as dictionary
- it is unordered data type it will noy support indexing
- it is mutable data type it can be modified
- duplicates are not allowed
- set is both homogenious and hetrogenious type but it allows only immutable i.e string, tuple data types
### dictionary:
- elements in dictionary stored using curly brackets
- elements are stored in the form of "key" and "value" pair
- key and value seperated by (:) key value pair is seperated by comma(,)
- dictionary is ordered data type
- dictionary is mutable data type it ccan be modified
