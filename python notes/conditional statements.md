         else
         elif
## if:
- if the given condition is true then controll goes to inside if block
- if block is also called as TRUE block
- for if block else block is not mandatory
## else:
- if the given condition is flase then controll goes to else block
- else block is also called as FALSE block
- for else block else block is mandatory
## elif:
- if previous condition is flase then controll goes to elif block

- if there are multiple conditions to check then we use elif block
- syntax:
- if condition1
     statement1
     condition2
     stetement2
     condition n
     statement n
## Nested if:
- you can have if statements inside if stements this is called nested if statements
