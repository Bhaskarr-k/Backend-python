# operators in python?
- operator is nothing but a symbol
- operators are sue to perform operations on variables and values
- python divided the operators in the following :
-        Arthamtic operators
         Assignment operators
         Comparision operators
         Logical Operators
         Identity operators
         Membership operators
         Bitwise operators
## Arthmatic operators:
- Before gone through the arthamatic operators we know about this **pemdas** p stands for paranthesis() and e stands for exponent ** and m stands for multiplication and A stands for Addition and S stands for substraction  these pemdas called as precedence
-    + Addtion(x+y)
-    - substraction(x-y)
-    * multiplication(x*y)
-    / Division: it returns the output in the form of float value
-    % Modularity:
-    // Floor division: 

## Assignment operators:
- it is used to assining a value of variable update existing variable with new value
- Assignment operator assign with **=** symbol.

## comparision (or) relational operators:
- comparision operators are used to compare two values

## Logical operators:
- logical operators considered three operators that are logical AND  OR NOT
- **AND**:
-  both conditions are true output will be as true the first condition is false in AND operator then compiler will not goes to check second operator.
- |T|T|T|
  -------
  |T|F|T|
  -------
  |F|T|F|
  -------
  |F|F|F|
  -------
**OR**: 
- first ocndition is true in OR operator then ocntroll will not go on check on the second condition
- T T T
- T F T
- F T T
- F F F
- **NOT**:
- T F
- F T

## Bitwise operators:
- bitwise operators are used to compare binary numbers
- it is divided into six types they are given below
-    AND &
     OR |
     XOR ^
     NOT ~
     << LEFT SHIFT
     >> RIGHT SHIFT

## Identity operator:
- identity operators are used to compare the objects not if they are equal but if theya re actually the same object, with the same memoty location.
- it is divided into two types they are given below
- **is**: returns the if both variables are the same object
- **is not**: returns true of both variables are not the same object

## Membership operators:
- membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object
- **in**: returns true if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object
- **not in**: returns true if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object
