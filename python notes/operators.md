## Arthmatic operators:
- Before gone through the arthamatic operators we know about this **pemdas** p stands for paranthesis() and e stands for exponent ** and m stands for multiplication and A stands for Addition and S stands for substraction  these pemdas called as precedence
-    + Addtion(x+y)
-    - substraction(x-y)
-    * multiplication(x*y)
