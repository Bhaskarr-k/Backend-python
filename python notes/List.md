# Lists in python?
- elements inside list is declared using square brackets and seperated by comma
- list is ordered data type it supports indexing
- list is mutable data type it cant be modified
- in python list is both homogenous and hetrogenous 
- homogenious means same data type can store multiple values
- hetrogenious means it can be store values with diffrent data types
## list inbuilt methods:
- inbuilt methods are two that are for adding **add** and removing **remove**
### for adding list:
## append:
- append is adding the data is existing list
- this is used to add one value at a time and to the list
- this method will add element at the end of the list 
- append take only one value
## insert():
- this method is used to add one value at a time in particular index position
- if the index position is more than length of the list. then value is added at the end of the list
### diffrence between apppend and insert:
- by using append() method we can add a value at the end fo the list where as by using insert we can add at any index position
## extend:
- this method is used to add multipe values at a time to the list
- multiple values need to be provided in collection data type like [string, list, tuple, set, dictionary]
### removing elements from list:
## remove():
- this method is used to remove one value at a time
- if the value provided is availbe more than once than it will remove the first occurence of the value
- if the provided value is not availbe then it gives value error
## pop():
- pop() removes element based on the index position 
- it retruns the removed value
- if the index position is more than length of the list it throughs index error
### what is the diffrence between remove and pop:
- remove takes value as argument where as pop takes index as argument
- remove method will not return any value where as pop() returns remove method
- providing  argument is mandatorey in remove method where as in pop it is mandatorey
